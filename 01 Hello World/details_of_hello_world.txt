Program 1: Create a Flask app that displays "Hello, World!" on the homepage.
==========================================================================

Flask is a micro web framework for Python that allows you to build web applications easily.

Detailed Explanation of Hello World:

Step 1. Import Flask:
---------------------
from flask import Flask

import the Flask class from the Flask library, allowing you to create a Flask web application.

Step 2. Create a Flask application instance:
--------------------------------------------
app = Flask(__name__)

Here, we create an instance of the Flask class and assign it to the variable app. 
The __name__ argument is passed to Flask, and it helps Flask determine the root path of the application.

Step 3. Define a route and a view function:
-------------------------------------------
@app.route("/homepage")
def hello():
    return f"Hello, World!"

This code defines a route for the URL path "/homepage." When a user accesses this path in a web browser, the hello function is executed. 
The function simply returns the string "Hello, World!" as a response. This text will be displayed in the user's web browser when they visit the "/homepage" URL.

Step 4. Run the application:
----------------------------
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)

This block of code ensures that the Flask application only runs when the script is executed directly (not when it's imported as a module in another script). It also specifies the host and port on which the application should listen.

host="0.0.0.0" means the application will be accessible from any available network interface. This allows the application to be accessed both locally and externally.
port=8000 specifies that the application will listen on port 8000.


Step 5. Execute this Application:
---------------------------------

To run this Flask application, we should save the code in a Python file (e.g., "app.py"), and then execute the file. 
We can do this by running python app.py in your terminal. After running the application, you can access it in your web browser by visiting 
"http://localhost:8000/homepage" or "http://your-server-ip:8000/homepage" if you want to access it from another device on the same network.

When we access this URL, we'll see the "Hello, World!" message displayed in browser, as defined in the hello function.
