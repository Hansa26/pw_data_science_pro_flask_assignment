Program 5: Implement user sessions in a Flask app to store and display user-specific data.
==========================================================================================

Flask-Session:
--------------
Flask-Session is an extension for Flask that supports Server-side Session to your application.
The Session is the time between the client logs in to the server and logs out of the server.
The data that is required to be saved in the Session is stored in a temporary directory on the server.
The data in the Session is stored on the top of cookies and signed by the server cryptographically.
Each client will have their own session where their own data will be stored in their session.

Uses of Session:
----------------
Remember each user when they log in
Store User-specific website settings (theme)
Store E-Commerce site user items in the cart

This is specific to the flask_session library only:
---------------------------------------------------

SESSION_PERMANENT = False --> This session has a default time limit of some number of minutes or hours or days after which it will expire

SESSION_TYPE = "filesystem" --> It will store in the hard drive (these files are stored under a '/flask_session' folder in your config directory.) or any online id account,
and it is an alternative to using a Database or something else like that.


Step 1: Import Flask and Flask-Session:
---------------------------------------
We need to firstly import Flask and Flask-Session to handle session management

Step 2: Configuration:
----------------------
The configuration settings for Flask-Session are defined:
SESSION_PERMANENT: This setting is set to False, meaning the session has a default time limit before it expires.
SESSION_TYPE: It is set to "filesystem," indicating that session data will be stored on the server's hard drive.

Step 3: Create a Flask App:
---------------------------
The Flask application is created with "app = Flask(__name__)"

Step 4: Routes and Session Usage:
---------------------------------
The following routes and functionality are defined:
"/" (index): The index route retrieves the "username" key from the session and renders the "username.html" template,
passing the username for display. If the username is not in the session, it defaults to None.
"/set_session": This route is used to set the "username" key in the session. It handles POST requests.
When a user submits the form to set the username, the value is retrieved from the form and stored in the session.
After setting the session data, the user is redirected to the index page.

Step 5: Run the Flask App:
--------------------------
The Flask app is run with app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=8004). It listens on all network interfaces ("0.0.0.0") and port 8004.
